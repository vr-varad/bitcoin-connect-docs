# Why does Bitcoin Connect not work on some pages?

Bitcoin Connect must be imported at the root component or on every component that requires webln to ensure webln is available. If you only import the button in your settings page, you'll still need to import the library where you want to make a lightning payment. We recommend using the `requestProvider` function.
