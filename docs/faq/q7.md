# Is this safe?

You should have a certain level of trust on the website you decide to connect your wallet with, and that they ensure there is no malicious third-party scripts which would intend to read the wallet connection configuration, either from memory or storage. We heavily recommend to add [CSP rules](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Content_Security_Policy_Cheat_Sheet.html) to your site and follow [best practices](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html) to prevent XSS.

Connectors with budget controls or confirmation dialogs (Alby extension or NWC) are recommended so you have full control over your connection.
